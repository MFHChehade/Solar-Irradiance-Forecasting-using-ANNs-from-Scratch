# Solar-Irradiance-Forecasting-using-ANNs-from-Scratch
This works develops a deep artificial neural network (ANN) model to forecast solar irradiance at a given time and place based on several meteorological factors. 

The ANN is designed from scratch and optimized using gradient and stochastic gradient descent with diminishing step-size and gradient clipping. The weights of the neural network are initialized using a special scheme. The performance of the model is also compared to that of a linear regression model, also built from scratch. 

Special thanks to contributors on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dronio/SolarEnergy for providing the dataset, EDA, data preprocessing and a starting point for the neural network archiecture. It should be noted that the works present in the mentioned source utilize built-in functions for the machine learning task as opposed to this work and do not go through the process of optimization, step-size decision, gradient clipping and weights initialization. 

As for this project, one can run the main file, and it will take care of importing other files. A PDF report is also found in the repository. A presentation file is also found.
