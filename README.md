# Solar Irradiance Forecasting using ANNs from Scratch

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to forecasting solar irradiance using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) developed from scratch. It includes implementations of both a simple linear regression model for baseline comparison and a more complex ANN for detailed analysis.

## Repository Structure
- **Data**:
  - Contains the datasets used for training and testing the models, ensuring robust model evaluations.
- **Documentation**:
  - Provides comprehensive documentation on the methodology, model architecture, and results.
- **Models**:
  - `LinearRegression.py`: Implements a straightforward linear regression model as a baseline for forecasting performance.
  - `NeuralNetwork.py`: Develops a neural network model tailored for the nuances of solar irradiance data.
- `main.py`: The main script that ties together data handling, model training, and forecasting tasks.

## Getting Started
To run the forecasting models, ensure you have Python and necessary libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow) installed. Clone the repository, navigate to the root directory, and execute `main.py` to start the experiments.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have enhancements, additional models, or improvements, please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your proposed changes.
